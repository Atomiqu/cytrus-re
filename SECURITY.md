# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently don't really "version" our code, but the safest bet is to assume master is the current version (we might add a command to the bot to check what commit we're on).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities you find to Rexowogamer#1183 on Discord/send an email to beartechtalks@gmail.com.
